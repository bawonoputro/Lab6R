\usage{
greedy_knapsack(x, W)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame with two columns:
- `v`: A numeric vector representing the values of the items.
- `w`: A numeric vector representing the weights of the items.
Both vectors must be positive, numeric, and finite.}

\item{W}{A single positive numeric value representing the knapsack's capacity.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
  - `value`: Maximum total value achievable.
  - `elements`: A vector of the selected items that give the maximum value.
}
\description{
Solves the Knapsack problem using a greedy heuristic. The function selects items
based on their value-to-weight ratio (vi/wi) and adds them to the knapsack as long as they fit.
This method does not guarantee the optimal solution but provides a quick approximation.
