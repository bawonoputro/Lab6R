\title{Parallel Brute Force Function}
\usage{
parallel_brute_force_knapsack(x, W)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame with two columns:
- `v`: A numeric vector representing the values of the items.
- `w`: A numeric vector representing the weights of the items.
Both vectors must have the same length, and all values should be positive and finite.}

\item{W}{A single positive numeric value representing the knapsack's capacity.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
  - `value`: Maximum total value achievable.
  - `elements`: A vector of the selected items that give the maximum value.
}
\description{
Parallel Brute-force Knapsack

Solves the Knapsack problem using a parallel brute-force approach by evaluating all
possible combinations of items using more than one core simultaneously.
